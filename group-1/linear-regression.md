# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted values.

**Key Concepts:**

* Continuous Outcome
* Least Squares
* Coefficients

**Applications:**

* Predicting house prices
* Forecasting sales
